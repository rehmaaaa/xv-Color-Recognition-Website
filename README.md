Working Principle

Color Sensing: The sensor detects the color of a surface by analyzing reflected light.

Data Processing: The microcontroller processes sensor readings using calibration values.

Color Differentiation: Python-based algorithms refine the color detection process.

Output Display: The detected color is shown via LEDs or a screen for easy identification.

Calibration Process

To improve accuracy, the sensor must be calibrated using white and black reference materials. The system records intensity values from these surfaces and uses them to interpret new color readings effectively.

Calibration Steps:

Place a white material under the sensor and record the intensity values for red, green, and blue.

Repeat the process using a black material to establish the lower intensity threshold.

During operation, detected colors are compared to these reference values for precise identification.

Circuit Setup

Connect the Color Sensor:

VCC to 5V (or 3.3V, depending on the sensor)

GND to Ground

SDA to A4 (if using I2C communication)

SCL to A5 (if using I2C communication)
